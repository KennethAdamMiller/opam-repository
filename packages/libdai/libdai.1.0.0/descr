libdai opam package wrapper

libdai is a library for probability inference using factor graphs
and belief propagation algorithms. It therefore represents rather
burdensome computations that necessarily must run as expediently
as possible, and naturally is written in c++. To get this into 
ocaml, some swig was used to automatically generate wrappers.
